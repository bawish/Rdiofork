This script runs once a day to look for new tracks on Pitchfork's "Best New Tracks" page. 

New discoveries are added to a CSV. The script searches for each song on Rdio and adds it to a playlist if found.

This is my first significant coding project so probably not very sophisticated, but it seems to work just fine ;)

Version 2.0 (for the 2013 tracks) will be much improved!
